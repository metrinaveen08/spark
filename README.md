# Spark

A lightweight Java-based graphics/visuals project with shader support. Spark combines a modular Java core with GLSL shaders to provide real-time visual effects and rendering experiments.

> Note: This README is intentionally generic — it assumes a standard Java toolchain and common OpenGL bindings (LWJGL/JOGL). If your repository uses a specific build system or library, update the Build / Run section accordingly.

## Highlights

- Core implemented in Java (primary language)
- GLSL shader assets for visual effects and rendering (small portion of repo)
- Intended for realtime graphics experiments, demos, and shader development
- Minimal, modular structure making it easy to extend and integrate into apps

## Contents

Typical layout (adjust to match your repo):
- `/src` — Java source code
- `/shaders` — GLSL vertex/fragment shader files
- `/examples` — small demo applications or scenes
- `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` — build configuration (if present)

## Requirements

- Java 11+ (or the Java version your project targets)
- A Java OpenGL binding (recommended: LWJGL, JOGL) or another rendering backend
- Gradle or Maven if your repo uses them (or just `javac`/`jar` for manual builds)
- GPU drivers that support the required GLSL version used in `shaders/`

## Build & Run

Below are example commands for common setups. Replace with the actual build commands/config for this repo.

Using Gradle (if present):
```bash
# build
./gradlew build

# run (if a run task exists)
./gradlew run
```

Using Maven (if present):
```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/spark.jar
```

Manual (javac + jar):
```bash
# compile
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")

# package
jar --create --file=spark.jar -C out .

# run
java -cp spark.jar com.yourcompany.Main
```

If your application depends on LWJGL/JOGL, ensure native libraries are available on the JVM library path. Example for LWJGL (when using an assembled jar/shadowJar) is typically handled by the Gradle/Maven build.

## Shaders

GLSL shaders live in the `shaders/` directory. Typical shader workflow:

- Modify `.vert` / `.frag` files in `shaders/`
- Hot-reload support: if the app supports it, you can edit shader files while the app is running and press the reload key (implement a reload listener in your engine)
- Check GLSL version directives at top of each shader (e.g., `#version 330 core`)

## Configuration

- Command-line flags or a properties file can be used for runtime configuration (window size, vsync, shader selection, etc.). Add a `config/` or `resources/` folder if not present.

## Examples

Add short descriptions of example demos you ship (replace these placeholders with real examples from the repo):

- `examples/particles` — GPU particle system driven by fragment shader
- `examples/postprocess` — fullscreen post-processing chain demonstrating bloom, tone mapping

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Implement your changes, add tests where applicable
4. Open a pull request with a clear description and related issues

Please include:
- A short description of changes
- Build and run steps for any examples or demos added
- Any shader changes and target GLSL versions

## Troubleshooting

- If a shader fails to compile, check the OpenGL context and GLSL version compatibility.
- For runtime crashes related to native libraries, confirm the correct native bindings for your platform (x86_64 vs aarch64).
- Enable logging in your Java app to capture shader compile errors and GL errors.
